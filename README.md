# Project Name: Swing Bash

## Description:
Swing and Survive is a simple game developed using C++ and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. The game incorporates physics elements such as gravity, momentum, and collision detection to create an engaging gameplay experience. The objective of the game is to navigate the main object, gain points by colliding with friendly objects, and avoid colliding with enemy objects or lava.

## Controls:
- Press and hold the left mouse button to attach a rope from the main object to a nearby object.
- While holding the left mouse button, the main object will swing in a circular motion around the attached object.
- Release the left mouse button to detach the rope and allow the main object to fall under the influence of gravity with conservation of momentum.

## Game Features:
- The game starts with the main object freely falling under the influence of gravity.
- The player can attach the main object to nearby objects using the rope mechanics, enabling circular motion.
- Detaching the rope releases the main object, subjecting it to gravity and conservation of momentum.
- Colliding with red enemy objects or lava results in the main object's demise and ends the game.
- Colliding with white friendly objects increases the main object's score and total points.
- The game includes menus for starting, retrying, and exiting the game.
- Text rendering, visual effects, and sound effects enhance the gaming experience.
- Vector calculus principles, including Newton's laws of motion, conservation of momentum, and circular motion, are utilized in the game's physics simulation.

## Requirements:
- C++ compiler
- SDL library

## Instructions:
1. Ensure that a C++ compiler and the SDL library are installed on your system.
2. Compile and build the source code files using the C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file to start the game.
4. In the main menu, select "Play" to begin the game or "Exit" to quit the game.
5. Control the main object by pressing and holding the left mouse button to attach the rope to nearby objects.
6. Release the left mouse button to detach the rope and allow the main object to fall freely.
7. Gain points by colliding with white friendly objects and avoid colliding with red enemy objects or lava.
8. The game ends when the main object collides with an enemy object or lava.
9. In the end menu, select "Retry" to restart the game or "Exit" to quit the game.

Note: Please refer to the project documentation or comments within the code for more details on customization, adding new features, or modifying gameplay elements.
